## Introduction

Petrified is a bash client to update dynamic DNS at freedns.afraid.org;
the goals are for simplicity, flexibility and configurability which using
the minimal system tools installed with most distributions.

## Features

- Several configuration methods:
 * /etc/petrified.conf
 * ~/.petrifiedrc
 * -c (config) on the commandline
- IPv4 and IPv6 support
- PID usage to prevent race conditions or stacked crons
- Logging via journald, syslog, stdout and a logfile simultaneously
- Local IP reporting for use with internal DNS entries
- Caching of the last IP to reduce upstream impact
- Usable via cron, NetworkManager dispatcher, commandline, etc.

## Dependencies

| Utility | Package     |
| --------|-------------|
| logger  | util-linux  |
| kill    | util-linux  |
| printf  | coreutils   |
| touch   | coreutils   |
| date    | coreutils   |
| cat     | coreutils   |
| rm      | coreutils   |
| bash    | bash        |
| ip      | iproute2    |
| curl    | curl        |


## Configuration

Copy the default configuration file to */etc/petrified.conf* for global
use, *~/.petrifiedrc* for user-level use, or another location as desired.
At a minimum the **DDNS_KEY** variable must be configured for basic usage;
all other variables are preconfigured for system level (root) usage.

If implementing at the user level, be sure and set the various file location
options to a directory that is writable by the user; the default config is
fully documented and should make sense.

## Usage

Usage is simple - just run **petrified** and check your log(s).

To use a custom configuration file, the **-c (config)** parameter is 
supported; note that using this option will *not* read the global/local
configuration files and only use the variables from this custom file.

The original version of petrified was influenced by these two software
package's concepts, however actual code was not used.
